## Installation

Klepto is written in Go with support for multiple platforms. Pre-built binaries are provided for the following:

You can download the binary for your platform of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/hellofresh/klepto/releases).

Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. We recommend that you move it into your `$PATH` for easy use, which is usually at `/usr/local/bin`.
